    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
      My name is Jude Samuel, and I was born in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria
      and I’m from the Igbo tribe. My journey began in the suburbs of the city
      where I spent my early years surrounded by a loving christian family,
      friends and nature. Growing up in a bustling but average household with
      four siblings, life was always an adventure. In those early years, I was
      fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology, despite limited
      access. I spent countless hours exploring the digital realm with the
      devices available at that time, dismantling old electronics, and piecing
      together little domestic devices like torches and toys. I vividly remember
      taking apart my first toy truck given to me, by my aunt, as a gift to see
      how it worked, only to spend hours trying to put it back together. Even
      though I wasn’t successful, these early experiences instilled in me a
      strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for the power of knowledge, even
      amidst the circumstances. Through trial and error, I learned the
      importance of perseverance and the satisfaction of overcoming challenges.
      I had my basic education there in Abuja and while I was fortunate to have
      access to quality education within the city, my experiences was widely
      confined to the familiar surrounding of Abuja. This has instilled in me a
      deep yearning to explore the world beyond my immediate environment. I am
      eager to travel, to immerse myself in different cultures, and to broaden
      my horizons through new experiences. Today, I am driven by a desire to
      create something that helps the whole world and contribute to the
      development and advancement of the future.
